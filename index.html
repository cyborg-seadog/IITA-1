    <p>I was born and raised in Australia. I have lived most my life in Brisbane and Adelaide, however I now live in Alice Springs.
      I have two sides in my family, being that of Aboriginal and Irish, it seems I got all the Irish traits.
      I have only completed a year 11 education, and this will be my first time studying at a university.
I mainly speak English but speak a little bit of Russian. I have a big fat ginger cat named Keith that I adopted from a shelter,
I enjoy working out and martial arts. I have competed in both Muay Thai and Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, however I like BJJ a bit more as I don’t get punched in the face…(as often).

    <h1>INTEREST IN IT</h1>
    <p>I am interested in the programming side of IT, however Cyberwarfare is what I really aspire
to become a part of. Being able to safeguard vital information and data from malicious
users is an important role that I believe is needed more than ever now. My interests in IT came
about whilst I was in the Military when I worked with an Intellegence officer, who also had a
background in computers. He had exlpained how so many systems were vulnerable to a cyber attack
and how it could cripple our Defence Force, even down to a single soldiers Facebook account
being enough to expose vital information.
</p>

<p>My own experience in IT would be mostly from using work computers, and using specific equipment
  to the job (i.e encrypted radios, GPS and even drones). I have played around with Kali Linux and
  the tools within, however I am still trying tounderstand it all. I have also started slowly learning
  Python-3.</p>

<p>RMIT was strongly recommended to me by a student advisor, who has a background in Cybersecurity,
  and given me a path to follow in obtaining a Cybersecurity qualification. I hope to learn skills
  that will help me learn even more specialized skills I can use in the future to obtain a career and
  skills I can be proud of (and show off to my mates).</p>

<p>↑</p>

<p>The ideal job for me would be Penetration tester. You get to find vulnerabilities in networks and
systems while possibly coming up with defences for them as well. While a lot of workspaces use computers
today, a lot of people are unaware of the security risks involved, and I would like to be part
of a team that helps bring light to these and help make a more secure environment.

    <h1> PERSONAL PROFILE</h1>

    style="width:600px;height:150px;">

<h2>Results of the MBTI</h2>
    <p>The results of the MBTI indicate that I excel at interacting with people. I can get a team together and bring out the
      best in people within that team. Naturally curious and open minded, the only bad idea is no idea, I am not afraid to try something new.
      Able to get people enthusiastic for new ideas as well as showing interest in others and being able to communicate with almost anyone about anything.
      I strive to find the best in people and lift their spirits to help themselves and the team. This is my interpretation of the results.</p>

    <p>I believe seeing these results will have me gravitate towards the diplomat of the team. I will try to resolve conflicts, encourage communication
      between the team members and make everyone feel they belong in the team. I will constantly bring forward new ideas and humbly withdraw it if a better one is proposed.</p>

    <p>I should look for members who are actively participating in this course and are genuinely interested in brainstorming with others.
I can’t provide any critiques for this result as it is scary accurate! </p>

<h2>Learning Style</h2>
<a  href="https://www.how-to-study.com/learning-style-assessment/" target="_blank">How-to-study</a>

<p>I am a monkey-see-monkey-do kind of learner. I learn best when I can see a teacher/mentor do the task in front of me or use illustrations to demonstrate what’s required.
I will need to see other peoples work rather than hear them explain it to me. This should not be an issue as canvas has the tools to do so.
I will try to team up with people who explain things better by showing or basically, drawing a diagram.
</p>

<h2>Emotional intelligence</h2>
<a href="https://globalleadershipfoundation.com/geit/eitest.html" target="_blank">Emotional Test</a>

<p>The results of this test shows that I have very good social awareness. This ties in with the results from the MBTI, which corroborates the "diplomat" type.
  I will mostly be aware of how members of the team are feeling and attitudes adjust my behaviour accordingly. </p>

    <h1>PROJECT IDEA</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Application that lets you view what nationalities visit what places abroad. This app will allow users to see hotspots of their chosen nationality filter.
You will bring up the app, choose a location from the filters and hit ok, bringing up locations around the world in which people from specific nations have logged in at.
The hotspots will be colour coded for ease of use when filtering for different countries.</p>


<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>If you are a solo traveller or with some friends going to a new country, it may be a bit overwhelming or confusing exploring a new place.
You may be in a new country where English is not the first language and are struggling to get around.
This app will help people meet others from their own country or speak the same language, allowing for users to make new connections and
feel more comfortable travelling around the foreign land. This can be useful for tourists to visit attractions or vice versa, avoid areas with
high volumes of traffic. This can also be a useful tool for refugees who flee from their country with no support, to find others from their native country.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The application will be free to download, however will require that you make an account. The main screen will be a map of the world that you can interact with.
At the top left will be a drop-down menu that will display profile, filters for countries, settings and help.
The profile link will take you to a sub-menu which will display options for your profile such as changing your profile picture, selecting your home country or
 country of your choosing, username and a short bio about yourself and an anonymous tab, the anonymous tab will be explained later.</p>

<p>Within the filters tab, you will be able to choose which countries to display on the map in a type of heat signature configuration and
choose the map style i.e. topographic, satellite. The heat signatures will be constantly updated by other users of this service and hotspots can change with time for each country.
You will be able to choose multiple countries in the filters, so for example, you’re an Australian in a non-English speaking Country and want to find people that speak English or are from Australia,
you could set the filter to only display countries that primarily speak English i.e. America, Canada, Britain, Australia and the map will display hotspots where people from those
countries have pinged in at.</p>

<p>Users can have the option to anonymously ping to produce a heat signature or ping with their profile and leave a little blurb about the location.
Anonymous pinging can be turned on in the profile menu using a slide tab. With the latter option, users can view the profile that has left a message and speak with them directly,
 however if the person who left the ping does not wish to be contacted, they can turn off receiving messages from other users in the settings menu.</p>

<p>You will be able to download the most recent snapshot of the maps heat signatures beforehand. You can choose specific countries or download them all, from in the past to present.
This will be very useful for say a refugee who intends on coming to a different country but has no means of getting internet or mobile service,
they could view where the most recent congregation of their home country is and travel to that spot.
The settings tab will have options such as origin Country, dark/light theme, info about the app, password change, notification settings and language settings.
The help tab will display FAQ and advice on how to use the app.</p>

<h2>Tools and tech</h2>

<p>I will utilize the Mapbox mobile Software Development Kits (SDK) as well as their geocoding API.  The mobile SDK will allow me to customise the maps to be usable on a mobile device,
such as a tablet or phone, designate certain touch features to correspond with actions on the application and allow for use on either Android or IOS.
Mapboxes geocoding API will allow users to upload their data which will then be transferred onto the map for other to see.</p>

<p>Using the Datasets API specifically is how I intend on creating the software that will allow users to upload their data i.e., country and location as well as a little blurb if they wish.
As for the map design itself I will use Mapboxes vector, raster tiles and style API which will aide me in the design, layout and images required.
I will be able to use both standard topographic maps and satellite imagery.</p>

<p>As I intend to have this app run on both IOS and Android, I will utilise Transpiler, a tool that will translate one programming language to another.
I will also use a cloud service such as Azure or AWS to store data gathered from our users.</p>

<h2>Skills required</h2>

<p>I will need to be proficient or find people proficient in programming languages such as C-sharp, HTML5 and Swift, for the IOS platform.
For Android I will need to know Python, C/C++ or Java. I am currently learning Python and making connections with people who have or are working on obtaining these skills.
 Someone skilled in graphic design to assist with the interface of the application will be needed.
I will require someone skilled in Cybersecurity to assess and find any vulnerabilities in the application and make suggestions on how to better secure the app.</p>

<h2>Outcome</h2>

<p>The desired outcome I hope is for an app that will help people connect in foreign lands with people they already have something in common with.
This could be used for people wanting to meet like minded people abroad or for people who are completely lost in a new country and have no idea where to start.
Although the point of travelling really is to meet new people and see places different from your own, it is incredibly useful to meet people from a country like yours,
as they may have been in that foreign land longer than you and can give valuable information or advice.
